# React Chess Game

## Overview

This is an essential chess game built with ES6, React + Vite, and CSS. The game includes all the basic functionalities required for a proper chess game. The purpose of this project was to strengthen my programming logic in JavaScript and React, and also to improve my handling of React's asynchronous states and the Context API.

## Technologies Used

- ES6
- React + Vite
- CSS

## Installation

This game does not require any installation. It is hosted on a web server and can be played directly from your browser.

## How to Play

To start a new game, click on the "Start Game" button. To move a piece, click on the piece and then click on the square to which you want to move it.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to enhance the quality of the project with features like:

- Multiplayer functionality using Web Sockets
- Database integration with SQL
- Server-side logic with Express
- An AI opponent with different levels of difficulty
